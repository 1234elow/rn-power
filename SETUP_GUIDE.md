## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup (Supabase)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://zhvlwkobcjeloyefsjct.supabase.co

2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**

3. Run the SQL migration located at `/database/schema.sql`
   - This will create all necessary tables
   - Sets up indexes for performance
   - Creates automatic timestamp triggers

4. Verify tables were created:
   - Go to **Table Editor** and confirm you see:
     - `bookings`
     - `payments`
     - `admin_settings`

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file is already configured with:
- NextAuth credentials
- Supabase connection
- Admin login details

**IMPORTANT**: Change the default admin password!
- Current: `ChangeThisPassword123!`
- Login at `/admin/login` and update in settings

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:3000

### Step 4: Admin Login

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. Login with:
   - Email: `admin@renewedpower.com`
   - Password: `ChangeThisPassword123!`

### Step 5: Configure Stripe

1. Sign up for Stripe: https://dashboard.stripe.com

2. Get your API keys:
   - Go to **Developers ‚Üí API keys**
   - Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

3. Add keys to admin panel:
   - Go to `/admin/settings`
   - Paste your Stripe keys
   - Click **Save Settings**

4. (Optional) Set up webhooks:
   - Go to **Developers ‚Üí Webhooks**
   - Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `charge.refunded`
   - Copy webhook secret and add to settings

2. **Bookings**: Manage all appointments, filter by status
3. **Settings**: Update Stripe keys, switch between test/live mode

---

## üß™ Testing the Payment Flow

### Test Mode (Current Setup):

1. Make sure you're using Stripe **test keys** (pk_test_...)
2. Go through the booking flow
3. Use Stripe test card:
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date
   - CVC: Any 3 digits
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits

4. Submit payment
5. Check admin dashboard to see the booking with "completed" status

### Webhook Testing (Local Development):

1. Install Stripe CLI: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
2. Run: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Copy the webhook signing secret to your settings
4. Test payments - webhooks will update booking status automatically

---

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Never commit .env.local** - It's in .gitignore
2. **Change default admin password** immediately
3. **Use test keys** until ready for production
4. **Webhook secret** is required for production
5. **SSL certificate** required for production (webhooks)
